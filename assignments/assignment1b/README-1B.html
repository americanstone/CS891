<h3>Java Threads and Synchronizers (Assignment 1 - Part B)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objectives of Part B of this assignment are to learn how to
synchronize Java threads via a semaphore and a spin-lock.  Videos
describing Java Semaphores appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsQlNd3_kKU&t=5s&index=18&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha9TNSgbj38&index=19&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3">here</a>.
Likewise, a video describing spin-locks appears <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATrG7A5VWRE&index=14&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand these Java
synchronizers.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as
well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will use a semaphore and
spin-lock to enhance the multi-threaded implementation of the
PalantiriSimulator app
from <A HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1a/">Assignment
1A</A>. Assignment 1B focuses on the PalantiriManager, which is used
to restrict the number of beings from Middle-Earth who can
concurrently gaze into a fixed number of palantiri.  If you're not yet
a fan of Tolkien's Lord of the Ring's trilogy, you should drop
everything you're doing and read about
palantiri's <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">here</a>.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin and
Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 1B, however, you only need to be aware of the
following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/spinLockHashMap/">app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/spinLockHashMap</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>.</LI>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of JUnit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment.</LI>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.</LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 26, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 26. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>In addition to integrating the updated <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/RunnableThreadsMgr.java">RunnableThreadsMgr.java</A>
and <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/SimpleBeingRunnable.java">SimpleBeingRunnable.java</A>
files from your Assignment 1A solution, you'll need to modify several
files containing the skeleton Java code by completing the "TODO - You
fill in here" tasks to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE
OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO" tasks!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/spinLockHashMap">spinLockHashMap</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/spinLockHashMap/SpinLockHashMapMgr.java">SpinLockHashMapMgr.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a PalantiriManager via a Semaphore, a type of SpinLock, and
a HashMap.</LI>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/spinLockHashMap/ReentrantSpinLock.java">ReentrantSpinLock.java</A>
Students need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
emulate a "compare and swap"-style spin lock with recursive
semantics.</LI>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Assignment.java">Assignment.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" to set the <CODE>sTypes</CODE>
field to either <CODE>GRADUATE</CODE> or <CODE>UNDERGRADUATE</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI> 
</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A "correct" simulation should restrict the number
of gazing beings to the number of palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four palantiri in the simulation, then only four beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show palantiri and being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct and does not throw any exceptions the app title bar labels
will appear green when the simulation completes. If the implementation
throws an exception or is not implemented correctly when the
simulation completes the red title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1b/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using the Android Studio IDE and core Java
synchronization mechanisms, which complement the core Java
multi-threading mechanisms we covered in Assignment 1A.  It doesn't
require you to program any Java Executor framework or Android
concurrency frameworks, which we'll cover in upcoming assignments.</P>
